Here is the Github page for the paper **<font color=#FF0000 >A Margin-Maximizing Fine-Grained Ensemble Method</font>**.

 In addition to the code, it includes the PDF version of the paper, the dataset used, and the requirements. We have set a random seed to ensure that the results you obtain are consistent with those in the paper, provided that you use the same versions of third-party Python packages; otherwise, different results may occur. 

Notably, after the paper was published, Renwei Luo **<font color=#FF0000 >thoroughly reviewed the content and refactored the code, confirming the accuracy of the code and the resulting data more than three times</font>**.
